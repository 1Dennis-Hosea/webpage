<h2> Ball games</h2>
<p>I have engaged myself in differnt sports such as football, basketball, volleyball lawntennis and rugby. Once acted as a sports captain in rugby, and won two medals in basketball as a defendder. </p>
<h3> Music</h3>
<p1>I play a variety of instruments eg wind and key instruments.  </p>
<p2>I use my skills to try gain a difference to myself and my community. i believe with my knowledge I can bring a difference. I have done a number of projects. Quite challenging it was but I believe that on you move on more pressure you press and focus can lead to success. I went through Kenyan system of education and decided to take ICT so as to use it as a tool to make a difference in my society. </p>
